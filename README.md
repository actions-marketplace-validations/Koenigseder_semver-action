# Semver action

This GitHub Action can be used to easily create [SemVer](https://semver.org/) releases, based on labels set in a Pull Request.

## How to use it

Add a new GitHub workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder like this:

```yaml
name: Create new release

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  create-release:
    name: Create new release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create release
        id: create-release
        uses: Koenigseder/semver-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          base-branch: develop # Optional
          semver-prefix: v # Optional
          semver-start-version: 2.0.0 # Optional
          major-release-label: major release # Optional
          minor-release-lable: minor release # Optional
          patch-release-label: patch release # Optional
```

This workflow will create a new release each time a Pull Request gets merged into the `develop` branch, starting with `v2.0.0` in case the is no release so far.
